![Welcome](https://jasper.monster/sharex/github-top.png)

Hi, my name is Jasper and I'm from The Netherlands. I've been a website developer for 20+ years now, mostly focusing on WordPress. 

## My history
Born in 1982 in a small town in the south-west of The Netherlands, currently residing in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. Discovered webdesign as a passion very early on and did my share of creating awful websites hosted on Lycos, MySpace, you name it. Always had webdesign, copywriting and graphic design as the common thread through all my work. 

## My now
Currently I am freelancing for [Xolution](https://xolution.nl) and [Hebsite](https://hebsite.nl). I'm also a part-time streamer on Twitch, where I focus mostly on my other hobby: music and creating a community around shared interests.
